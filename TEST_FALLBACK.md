# Testing the Fallback System

## How to Test

1. **Open your application** and go to the User Management page
2. **Try to disable a user** - you should see:

   - First attempt tries Firebase Functions
   - If that fails with "Internal server error", it automatically tries the fallback method
   - The user should be disabled successfully

3. **Try to enable a user** - same process should work

4. **Try to delete a user** - should work with fallback method

## What to Look For

### In Browser Console:

You should see messages like:

```
Firebase Functions not available, using fallback method
```

### In the UI:

- User disable/enable should work immediately
- User delete should work (removes from Firestore)
- Error messages should be more descriptive

## Expected Behavior

1. **First attempt**: Tries Firebase Functions (will fail with "Internal server error")
2. **Automatic fallback**: Switches to direct Firestore methods
3. **Success**: User management operations complete successfully

## Troubleshooting

If the fallback system isn't working:

1. **Check browser console** for error messages
2. **Verify the error detection** is working by looking for the fallback message
3. **Check Firestore permissions** - make sure the user has admin role

## Success Indicators

✅ User disable works
✅ User enable works  
✅ User delete works (Firestore only)
✅ Clear error messages
✅ Automatic fallback detection
